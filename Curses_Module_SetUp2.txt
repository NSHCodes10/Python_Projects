The Rabbit and the Turtle
Once upon a time, in a beautiful forest, there lived a fast and proud rabbit and a slow but determined turtle. 
The rabbit always boasted about his speed, often making fun of the turtle for being slow.
One day, the turtle got tired of the rabbit's teasing and said,
Let’s have a race. I may be slow, but I never give up.
The rabbit burst into laughter. A race? With you? I will win in no time!" But he accepted the challenge.
The next morning, all the animals gathered to watch. The race began!
The rabbit ran very fast and soon left the turtle far behind.
The turtle, however, kept moving steadily, step by step.
Seeing that the turtle was far behind, the rabbit thought,
I have plenty of time. I can take a nap.
So he lay under a tree and fell asleep.
Meanwhile, the turtle kept going without stopping.
As the sun was setting, the turtle finally reached the finish line—just as the rabbit woke up in shock! 
The animals cheered for the turtle.
The rabbit ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. The turtle had won!
The turtle smiled and said,
Slow and steady wins the race.
From that day on, the rabbit never underestimated anyone again.
